So far, some interesting projects include applications to play mobile games, smart home 
organizers, or plugins for browsers or text editors. Since they may not be very large 
applications initially, common repository seems like the best option since it is quickly set up 
and gives each developer a fair amount of autonomy. Further down the line, it may be nessecary 
to switch over to a blessed repository depending on the amount of developers.
